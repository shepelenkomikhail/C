It's spring, Easter is coming. Mama Bunny has also prepared a collection of watering poems for the little bunny boys. Easter is in full swing and the boys are getting ready to water.

Mama Bunny (parent) keeps the watering poems in a file. When she hears a new poem, she continues to record it, possibly modifying it, but she chooses (at random) the most talented of the 4 bunny boys (children) and sends them to water the girls of the Bunny Family in the Friendly Bunny family in Barátfa. This Watering option should appear as a new menu item next to the previous ones. When the bunny boy arrives in Barátfa, he sends a signal to the mother, who in response sends 2 poems to the boy through a pipe. The boy writes these poems on the screen and then chooses one (random number). The chosen poem is sent back to mummy on a message queue. (This poem is not used later.) Then bunny boy tells the poem in Friend Tree (he writes it on the screen and then adds: "May I water! Then he waters the girls and returns home to Mama Bunny (terminal).

Create a C language program to do this task, the solution should run either on opsys.inf.elte.hu or on a Linux system similar to it. The solution must be presented to the tutor in the week following the deadline.

The source files (one code + one data file) should be uploaded here in zip format.
