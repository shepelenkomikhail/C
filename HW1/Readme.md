It's spring, Easter is coming. Mama Bunny is getting ready, too, and she's collecting watering poems for the little bunny boys. (Easter watering is very kind special Easter monday morning custom.)  Such poems as "Red eggs, green and white bunny, two kisses for a watering Bunny boy!"

Of course, there are those who know it a little differently.

Make a C language application that helps Mama Bunny to record the watering poems (add a new poem), list the poems she already knows, delete if necessary and modify an existing poem.

The poems are stored in a data file.

Create a C language program to do this task, the solution should run either on opsys.inf.elte.hu or on a Linux system similar to it. The solution must be presented to the tutor in the week following the deadline.

The source files (one code + one data file) should be uploaded here in zip format.
