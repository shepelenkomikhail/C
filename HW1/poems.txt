1. Red eggs, green and white bunny, two kisses for a watering Bunny boy!
2. Roses are red, violets are blue, sugar is sweet, and so are you.
3. Bunny hops and Easter cheer, bring joy to all who gather near.
4. Pink tulips bloom in the spring, a Bunny boy's heart starts to sing.
5. Easter eggs hidden out of sight, bring delight on Easter night.
